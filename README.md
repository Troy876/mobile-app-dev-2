## Personal Statement

Overall the project was quiet enjoyable, though I do wish I was able to do the user image uploading. Thankfully, with the project deadline being as long as it is, I never had to feel rushed in doing other projects in order to get this one done. The class material was also very clear to understand and organised in a way that gave me plenty of time to go over it. Being delivered through a hybrid/online model allowed me to stay at home to work on my FYP for much longer without needing to account for travel. Very flexible and enjoyable.
